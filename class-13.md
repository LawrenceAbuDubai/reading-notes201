# LOCAL STORAGE

One area where native client applications have a leg up on web applications is persistent local storage. The operating system often provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data such as preferences or runtime information for native programs. According to platform convention, these values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or another location. You can incorporate your own database, design your own file format, or use any number of different options if your native client application requires local storage beyond key/value pairs.
Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:

Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
What we really want is

a lot of storage space
on the client
that persists beyond a page refresh
and isn’t transmitted to the server
Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory in different ways.

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF LOCAL STORAGE HACKS BEFORE HTML5

There was only one browser at first: Internet Explorer. At least, that's what Microsoft wanted the rest of the world to believe. To that goal, Microsoft built a lot of items during the First Great Browser Wars and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars, Internet Explorer. DHTML Behaviors was one of these things, and userData was one of these behaviors.


In a hierarchical XML-based structure, userData allows web pages to hold up to 64 KB of data per domain. (Trusted domains, such as intranet sites, have ten times the storage capacity.) And, hey, 640 KB should suffice for most people.) IE does not present any form of permissions dialog.

In 2002, Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 that gained the unfortunate and misleading name of “Flash cookies.” Within the Flash environment, the feature is properly known as Local Shared Objects. Briefly, it allows Flash objects to store up to 100 KB of data per domain. Brad Neuberg developed an early prototype of a Flash-to-JavaScript bridge called AMASS (AJAX Massive Storage System), but it was limited by some of Flash’s design quirks. By 2006, with the advent of ExternalInterface in Flash 8, accessing LSOs from JavaScript became an order of magnitude easier and faster. Brad rewrote AMASS and integrated it into the popular Dojo Toolkit under the moniker dojox.storage. Flash gives each domain 100 KB of storage “for free.” Beyond that, it prompts the user for each order of magnitude increase in data storage (1 Mb, 10 Mb, and so on).

In 2007, Google released Gears, an open source browser plugin that adds further functionality to browsers. (We've previously discussed Gears in the context of Internet Explorer's geolocation API.) Gears provides an API to a SQLite-based embedded SQL database. Gears may store a limitless amount of data per domain in SQL database tables after receiving authorization from the user once.

## INTRODUCING HTML5 STORAGE


What I will refer to as “HTML5 Storage” is a specification named Web Storage, which was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.” The naming situation is made even more complicated by some related, similarly-named, emerging standards that I’ll discuss later in this chapter.

So what is HTML5 Storage? Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

Which browsers? Well, the latest version of pretty much every browser supports HTML5 Storage… even Internet Explorer!

HTML5 STORAGE SUPPORT
IE	FIREFOX	SAFARI	CHROME	OPERA	IPHONE	ANDROID
8.0+	3.5+	4.0+	4.0+	10.5+	2.0+	2.0+
From your JavaScript code, you’ll access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object. Before you can use it, you should detect whether the browser supports it.

## check for HTML5 Storage

function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
Instead of writing this function yourself, you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.

if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}


## USING HTML5 STORAGE


HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};
Calling setItem() with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. Calling getItem() with a non-existent key will return null rather than throw an exception.

Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the localStorage object as an associative array. Instead of using the getItem() and setItem() methods, you can simply use square brackets. For example, this snippet of code:

var foo = localStorage.getItem("bar");
// ...
localStorage.setItem("bar", foo);
…could be rewritten to use square bracket syntax instead:

var foo = localStorage["bar"];
// ...
localStorage["bar"] = foo;
There are also methods for removing the value for a given named key, and clearing the entire storage area (that is, deleting all the keys and values at once).

interface Storage {
  deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);
  void clear();
};
Calling removeItem() with a non-existent key will do nothing.

Finally, there is a property to get the total number of values in the storage area, and to iterate through all of the keys by index (to get the name of each key).

interface Storage {
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
  getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);
};
If you call key() with an index that is not between 0–(length-1), the function will return null.

TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE AREA
If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something. For example, if you set an item to its existing value or call clear() when there are no named keys, the storage event will not fire, because nothing actually changed in the storage area.

The storage event is supported everywhere the localStorage object is supported, which includes Internet Explorer 8. IE 8 does not support the W3C standard addEventListener (although that will finally be added in IE 9). Therefore, to hook the storage event, you’ll need to check which event mechanism the browser supports. (If you’ve done this before with other events, you can skip to the end of this section. Trapping the storage event works the same as every other event you’ve ever trapped. If you prefer to use jQuery or some other JavaScript library to register your event handlers, you can do that with the storage event, too.)

if (window.addEventListener) {
  window.addEventListener("storage", handle_storage, false);
} else {
  window.attachEvent("onstorage", handle_storage);
};
The handle_storage callback function will be called with a StorageEvent object, except in Internet Explorer where the event object is stored in window.event.

function handle_storage(e) {
  if (!e) { e = window.event; }
}
At this point, the variable e will be a StorageEvent object, which has the following useful properties.

STORAGEEVENT OBJECT
PROPERTY	TYPE	DESCRIPTION
key	string	the named key that was added, removed, or modified
oldValue	any	the previous value (now overwritten), or null if a new item was added
newValue	any	the new value, or null if an item was removed
url*	string	the page which called a method that triggered this change
* Note: the url property was originally called uri. Some browsers shipped with that property before the specification changed. For maximum compatibility, you should check whether the url property exists, and if not, check for the uri property instead.
The storage event is not cancelable. From within the handle_storage callback function, there is no way to stop the change from occurring. It’s simply a way for the browser to tell you, “hey, this just happened. There’s nothing you can do about it now; I just wanted to let you know.”
